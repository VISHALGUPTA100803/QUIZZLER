# QUIZZLER

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

I have maked a quiz app that tests your general knowledge. As one of the most popular types of apps on the app stores.

I have used
1- Stateful and Stateless Widgets and Classes and Objects.
2- Modularising your code into separate classes.
3- Dart classes and objects.
4- Using class constructors.
5- Extracting Widgets to refactor your code.
6- private and public modifiers in Dart.
7- Dart lists.
